<pre>
Translation - Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down.

transform: translateX(45px); - this will move object to the right 45px;
Scaling: The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically.
Rotate: I have used rotation previously to turn an object upside down.

trasform origin - changes the center of the circle to create intricate shapes.

Some browsers do not support those effects and so you must use other elements in their place.


Here are the steps to create a simple transition using only CSS:

Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.

Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.

Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties, including: transition-property , transition-duration , transition-timing-function , and transition-delay . We’ll look at each of these and how they work shortly.

-webkit- is needed for older browsers

The transition-duration Property - states the duration of the transition

Transition shorthand:

.ad-ad2 h1 span {
  transition-property: transform; 
  transition-duration: 0.2s;  
  transition-timing-function: ease-out;
  transition-delay: 50ms;
}

.ad-ad2 h1 span {
  transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;
}


KeyFrames
To animate an element, you must first create a named animation and then
attach it to an element in that element's property block.

Eample Canvas Setup:
"canvas id="myCanvas" class="myCanvas" width="200" height="200">
  Sorry! Your browser doesn’t support Canvas.
"/canvas>

.myCanvas {
  border: dotted 2px black;
}


to start drawing with javascript: 
var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var context = canvas.getContext("2d");

important for drawing on the canvas is the coordinate system
(0,0) is in the top-left corner.


toDataUrl will create a URL with an image.

I have done a little bit with SVG already but not heard of Raphael library.
It makes drawing and animating with SVG much easier.

  <h1>Questions</h1>
  <p>
    Is there a reason the text refers to "the canvas"? I can't help but feel like and elderly gentleman
    who says "the google".

    Because of the accessibiltiy concerns with Canvas, is it still widely used?
