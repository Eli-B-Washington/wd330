Chapter 8 - Forms

One thing I need to work on is event listeners.  I tend to write javascript to do these tasks because I learned javascript first.

const input = form.elements.searchInput;

input.addEventListener('focus', () => alert('focused'),
➥ false);


The example below shows the form not submitting.

const form = document.forms['search'];
form.addEventListener ('submit', search, false);
function search() {
alert(' Form Submitted');
}

function search(event) {
  alert('Form Submitted');
  event.preventDefault();
  }

  //
  input.addEventListener('focus', function(){
    if (input.value==='Search Here') {
    input.value = ''
    }
    }, false);
    input.addEventListener('blur', function(){
    if(input.value === '') {
    input.value = 'Search Here';
    } }, false);
    
This is to set focus on a form field
    document.forms.hero.heroName.focus();

 To iterate over a checkbox:
 hero.powers = [];
for (let i=0; i (lessthan) form.powers.length; i++) {
if (form.powers[i].checked) {
hero.powers.push(form.powers[i].value);
}
}


The event.preventDefault() is actually something that I have never used for form validation but it seems pretty easy to use.

This is to add an error message on a keyup event:

const label = form.querySelector('label');
const error = document.createElement('div');
error.classList.add('error');
error.textContent = '! Your name is not allowed to start
➥ with X.';
label.append(error);
function validateInline() {
const heroName = this.value.toUpperCase();
if(heroName.startsWith('X')){
error.style.display = 'block';
} else {
error.style.display = 'none';
Forms 311
}
}


This is the css so that the error does not appear initially:

  .error{
  background: #f99;
  border: #900 1px solid;
  display: none;
  }

Chapter 12: Object Oriented Programming
encapsulation:  keeping all the programming logic inside an object
polymorphism: the same process can be used for different objects.
inheritance: taking the features of one object then adding some new
features.




Javascript class declaration

class Dice {
  constructor(sides=6) {
  this.sides = sides;
  }
  roll() {
  return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)
  }
  }

JavaScript uses a prototypal inheritance model. This means that every class has a
prototype property that is shared by every instance of the class. 

i was wondering what prototype meant when working with array functions.

By default, an object’s methods are public in JavaScript.

All objects have a constructor property that returns the constructor function that
created it.

Changing the value of a prototype will change the value in all instances of the class.


The following shows how an object instance can overwrite properties of the methods inherited:

leo.weapon = 'Katana Blades';
Overwriting a Prototype
It is not possible to overwrite the prototype by assigning it to a new object literal if
class declarations are used:
Turtle.prototype = {}
 {}
Even though it looks like the prototype has been reassigned to an empty object
literal, we can see see it hasn’t actually changed:
Turtle.prototype
 Turtle { attack: [Function], weapon: 'Feet' }
It is possible to do this if constructor functions are used, and it can cause a lot of
headaches if you accidentally redefine the prototype. This is because any instances
that have already been created will retain the properties and methods of the old
prototype, but will not receive any of the new properties and methods that are
subsequently added to the redefined prototype.
This is another reason why it’s recommended to use class declarations instead of
constructor functions.
454 JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition
 'Katana Blades';
raph.weapon = 'Sai';
 'Sai'
don.weapon = 'Bo Staff';
'Bo Staff'

properties can be enumerable or non-enumerable.  Enumerable means it can be "seen" by a for-in loop.

You can inherit with the word extends just like in java.

A mixin is a way to add a has-a relationship.


Chapter 15

Modular Javascript - a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods.


For example, a very simple Pi module would have the following code saved in a
file called pi.js

this is how you would import it:
import { PI } from './pi.js';
