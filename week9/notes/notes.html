  The Window Object - Chapter 9

  Every JavaScript environment has a global object.

  In a browser, the global object is the window.

  x = 6;  // global variable created
 6
window.x // same variable can be accessed as a property of the window object
 6
// both variables are exactly the same
window.x === x;
true

There are many different global functions that can be access by calling window.

The assign() method can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter, for example:


Each window object contains a document object.

It as well contains many methods which you can call wil document."";
For example.  Document.write("Hello World!")

below woud write the same phrase without overwriting the document.
h1>
  script>document.write("Hello, world!")/script>
/h1>

you can create cookies with: document.cookie = "name=Superman"

you can change a cookie by assigning a new value to an exisiting variable name.

The setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements on a web page.

HTML API's Chapter 14:


example of storing information with localstorage.

localStorage.setItem('name', 'Walter White');

localStorage.getItem('name'); 
"Walter White"


You can also set the value by assignment:
localStorage.name = 'Heisenberg'; 
console.log(localStorage.name); 
 "Heisenberg";

 removeitem - 
 localStorage.removeItem('name');

 you can also use delete localStorage.name;

 The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device.

 Web Workers - allow for for processes to run in the background. 

 Shared Web Workers - allow lots of different scripts on the same domain to access the same worker object;

 Service Workers - allows a worker script to run in the background with the
  added benefit of being able to intercept network requests.

  WebSockets - allows two-way communication with a server.  Responses are pushed to the client as soon as they are
  received.
