Chapter 10- Testing and Debugging

System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with
which the program is interacting.

Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it
could even be as simple as a typo.

User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is
unable to handle.

Exception - An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the
program to deal with the error.

warning - an error in the code but the program will continue to run.

debugging - create breakpoints. Because alert() stops a program from running until
OK is clicked, it allows us to effectively put breakpoints in the code.

One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will create a
breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you
to see where the program is currently up to.

javascript uses try catch blocks. 

Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual
code.

Installed Jest.

  <h1>Questions</h1>
    So strict mode is a way to better enforce quality control?
    How often are linting tools used in the real world?  It seems like a great way to introduce quality control but also the programs
    can be a but picky.
    What are the differences between javascript try/catch blocks and java try catch blocks?
