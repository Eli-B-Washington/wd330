  <h1>Week 02 Notes</h1>

<pre>
 Using const and let to declare variables means they are block scoped, so their
value only exists inside the block they are declared in.

Javascripts built in functions use camelCase.


Const - you cannot change the value later on
Let - you can update the value in a function block
var - normally shouldn't be used


Lots of good functions in the readings that i tend to forget about, like
name.endsWith('A'); or name.charAt(1);


.pop() to remove the last item of an array.

The join() method can be used to turn the array into a string that comprises all
the items in the array, separated by commas:

.indexOf to find the value of a particular item

One thing I haven't looked into too is maps.

to declare a new map()
const romanNumerals = new Map();

to set a value-
romanNumerals.set(1,'I');

to set multiple at a time-
romanNumerals.set(2,'II').set(3,'III').set(4,'IV').set(5,'V')
âž¥ ; Map { 1 => 'I', 2 => 'II', 3 => 'III', 4

here is how to get the item based off of the key-
romanNumerals.get(4);


Basic function with a parameter and then the argument that you provide.
function square(x){
return x*x;
}

square(4.5);
20.25


I have never used a rest parameter so this was cool to learn about.

We can use a rest parameter to improve our mean() function so it accepts any
number of values:
function mean(...values) {
let total = 0;
for(const value of values) {
total += value;
}
return total/values.length;
}
</pre>


  <h1>Questions</h1>
  <p>I am still unsure of the reasons for declaring functions in different ways. Is it important to know them for just
      the value of reading code?
